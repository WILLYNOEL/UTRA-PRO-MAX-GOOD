# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

##     implemented: true

Interface utilisateur vérifiée par capture d'écran - le champ apparaît correctement avec styling professionnel. Variable d'état useful_pressure déjà existante, maintenant connectée à l'interface. Prêt pour tests backend pour vérifier intégration avec calculs HMT."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

DN32 and DN20 with high flow rates trigger recommendations, DN100 with adequate diameter shows no recommendations. ✅ DN CONVERSION FUNCTIONS: get_dn_from_diameter() function working correctly - exact DN matches (42.4mm → DN32), superior DN selection (45.0mm → DN40), large diameters (200.0mm → DN200), minimum DN handling (15.0mm → DN20). ✅ CURRENT DN REFERENCE: Recommendations correctly reference user-selected DN values in format 'DN{current} à DN{recommended}'. ✅ NO MM FORMAT: Old millimeter format completely eliminated from recommendations. ✅ MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY: DN conversion mathematically correct and uses superior DN when needed. ✅ EXTREME CASES: System handles extreme cases correctly (DN20 with 150 m³/h shows 'DN20 à DN200'). NPSHd DN recommendations functionality is production-ready and meets all requirements from review request."

All requirements from review request successfully validated: ✅ Compatible combination (Water + PVC) shows compatibility confirmation with appropriate joint recommendations (EPDM, NBR, CR Néoprène) and technical notes for potable water applications. ✅ Incompatible combination (Acid + Cast Iron) triggers comprehensive incompatibility warnings including corrosive fluid precautions, material alternatives (Inox 316L optimal, PVC/PP economical), specialized bolting requirements, protective coatings, pH monitoring protocols, and emergency rinse equipment requirements. ✅ Specialized fluid (Seawater + Steel) provides marine-specific recommendations including critical corrosion warnings, mandatory material upgrades (Inox 316L minimum, Duplex 2205 ideal), sacrificial anodes, cathodic protection, chloride monitoring, and fresh water rinse procedures. ✅ Food grade fluid (Milk + PVC) shows comprehensive food safety recommendations including sanitary material specifications (Inox 316L polished), FDA/CE certified joints, CIP cleaning integration, steam tracing, HACCP validation, and rapid cooling protocols. Chemical compatibility analysis is fully integrated into NPSHd calculations and ready for production use."
