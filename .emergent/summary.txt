<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory focused on iteratively enhancing the ECO PUMP EXPERT application. Initial efforts addressed UI bugs like non-functional dropdowns and high flow rate calculation issues in the Expert Solaire tab. A major phase involved integrating advanced hydraulic features: graduated diameter recommendations with cost-benefit analysis, strict velocity limits, and detailed chemical compatibility across various calculation tabs (NPSHd, HMT, Performance, Expert).

A significant part of the work transformed the AUDIT tab. This evolved from fixing its display issues and backend data mismatches to implementing a comprehensive, real-time expert report. The report was enhanced with cross-referenced hydraulic and electrical diagnostics, mechanical fault analysis, and detailed corrective actions, eventually becoming collapsible and exportable to PDF.

The final major feature involved developing a new, independent Réservoir tab for bladder tank calculations. This included implementing complex formulas, fixing specific ratio values, and adding an Analyse Existant sub-tab for existing installation recommendations. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly in identifying and resolving frontend JSX errors and numerical input handling issues, ensuring robust and user-centric feature delivery.

<product_requirements>
The goal was to deliver a professional, branding-free ECO PUMP EXPERT application with robust core functionality. Initially, the application faced issues such as non-working dropdowns and empty results for high flow rates in the Expert Solaire tab.

Key requirements addressed throughout the development include:
1.  **UI/UX Enhancements:** Improving the aesthetics and organization of the Expert tab and fixing persistent diameter dropdown display issues across HMT, Performance, and Expert tabs.
2.  **Calculation Debugging:** Resolving issues with Expert Solaire for flow rates exceeding 204 m³/j.
3.  **Advanced Recommendations:** Implementing detailed chemical compatibility analysis, graduated diameter recommendations (Excellent-Moyen) with cost-benefit analysis, and adherence to hydraulic velocity limits (<4m/s). These advanced logics were applied to NPSHd, HMT, Performance, and Expert tabs.
4.  **Recommendation Organization:** Deduplicating and structuring recommendations in the Expert tab while preserving detailed information.
5.  **Pression Utile Input:** Adding a pression utile (useful pressure) field to the HMT tab.
6.  **AUDIT Tab Transformation:** Developing the AUDIT tab into a comprehensive expert tool capable of real-time analysis, comparing current vs. initial values, and generating a detailed expert report with hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical diagnostics, prioritized recommendations, and phased action plans, including PDF export and collapsible sections.
7.  **Réservoir Tab Development:** Creating an independent tab for bladder tank calculations (fixed/variable speed pumps), calculating tank size, max service pressure, nominal diameter, and providing recommendations for existing installations.

-   **Reservoir Calculator Numerical Input Handling**: The  function in  still needs its numerical input handling corrected to prevent runtime errors when data is entered.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the newly implemented Réservoir (Bladder Tank) calculation tab. The user reported a runtime error occurring when entering data into the fields of this tab, specifically indicating that values were not being correctly parsed as numbers before mathematical operations (e.g., ).

The core problem identified was the attempt to apply numerical methods () on string values received from input fields within the  component. The AI engineer had already begun addressing this by modifying the generic  function to correctly  values:

This change aimed to ensure that all numerical inputs are converted to floats, with empty strings defaulting to 0, to prevent errors.

Furthermore, the AI engineer had also corrected other calculation functions, such as , within the  to explicitly handle numerical inputs.

The very last action of the AI engineer was to **correct the  function** in  in a similar manner, ensuring that all data processed within this specific analysis function is also correctly treated as numerical values, thereby resolving the user-reported runtime error and ensuring the robustness of the Analyse Existant sub-tab. This is where the work left off.
